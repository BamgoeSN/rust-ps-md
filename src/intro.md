# Introduction

This book is a collection of snippets for competitive programming and problem solving with Rust. All you have to do for using snippets is simply copying snippets you need and pasting them into your code.

## Usage

Each snippet can be easily copied by clicking on the copy icon <i class="fa fa-copy"></i> at the top right corner of a code block.

Clicking on the search icon <i class="fa fa-search"></i> in the menu bar, or pressing the `S` key on the keyboard will open an input box for entering search terms. Any keywords included in this book can be searched by typing it in the box.
